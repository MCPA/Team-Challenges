Introduction to Cryptology
======

### Description

This HoT practice covers transposition and substitution from a cryptography challenge. Nate and Leander began working through a 2014 Crypto challenge from CSAW. So far it uses cesear cipher and probably a substitution cipher. It also requires you to automate your solution while solving the challenge in multiple stages / parts. Between the two of us we will talk about how we went about solving the challenge and problems we faced in the process. This will help all of you with developing your own methodology and teaming strategies when working with other team members. We will also cover some interesting techniques we used in our exploitation script to solve the challenge. 

### Pre-reading Material

The first link has a good description of frequency analysis, the second link provides an overview of substitution ciphers, the third link covers transposition ciphers, and the last link provides an online tool suite for conducting cryptanalysis. If you choose to only read 2 of the articles from the links check out the 2nd and 3rd links.

### Summary  
Once again it will be hosted live via Google Hangouts on Air, 26 September from 2030-2230 EST - materials will be posted on our github site[here](https://github.com/MCPA/Team-Challenges/tree/master/crypto/substitution).
