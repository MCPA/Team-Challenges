Introduction to x86 Assembly and more overflows
======

### Description

This practice session was covered during a HoT session on 21 November at 2030 PM EST. It provided a basic introduction to x86 Assembly and how a buffer overflow looks inside the stack. It does require some basic knowledge of programming in order to understand some concepts, but everything is very basic and is intended to provide the participant a starting point for assembly programming. Essentially, you can grab your basic building blocks from this presentation and begin to learn x86 Assembly on your own through self-study.
