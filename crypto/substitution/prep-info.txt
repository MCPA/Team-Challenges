Our next practice will cover transposition and substitution from a cryptography challenge. Over the past weekend Nate Hicks and
I began working through a 2014 Crypto challenge from CSAW. So far it uses cesar cipher and probably a substitution cipher. It
also requires you to automate your solution while solving the challenge in multiple stages / parts. Between the two of us we
will talk about how we went about solving the challenge and problems we faced in the process. This will help all of you with
developing your own methodology and teaming strategies when working with other team members. We will also cover some interesting
techniques we used in our exploitation script to solve the challenge. As always here is some pre-reading material:

The first link has a good description of frequency analysis, the second link provides an overview of substitution ciphers, the
third link covers transposition ciphers, and the last link provides an online tool suite for conducting cryptanalysis. If you
choose to only read 2 of the articles from the links check out the 2nd and 3rd links.
