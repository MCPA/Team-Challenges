Introduction to Packet Capture Analysis
======

### Description
This practice session covers a challenge using pcap analysis called "pa050".

### Pre-reading Material
* https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/02/anatomy_of_a_brutef.html
* http://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2062/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-to-detect-and-to-break-xor-encryption
* http://digital-forensics.sans.org/blog/2013/05/14/tools-for-examining-xor-obfuscation-for-malware-analysis

At a minimum take a look at the 2nd reference. It describes how an XOR key works and is key for getting the flag for the 
challenge. The 1st reference provides background for what is occurring in the pcap and the 3rd reference provides several
tools recommended by SANS to use with XOR decoding.

### Summary  
In this walk-thru I will focus on parsing through the small pcap, some things to look at in a pcap when you are conducting 
analysis, and then walk through another team's method of solving the pa050 challenge. I've created a new repo on our github 
site that will host materials we cover in this monthly practice sessions located @ https://github.com/mcpa. 

Last, just like last time after I'm done with the walk-thru time dependent we can try some live events online. The goal is 
for this session to last between 1-2 hours depending on interest. I'm still working on a good way to work through how we 
all participate online together and yet record the session at the same time. For now - it will work the same way as last 
time - an onair google hangout.
